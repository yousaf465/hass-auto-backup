This is done by reducing the frequency of backups as they get older. </p> <p>Personally I take a backup of the Home Assistant configuration every 3 hours for the first 2 days, then full backups each day for a week, and finally each week for a month.</p> <p>For example, lets say my database has corrupted and I want to restore it.</p> <p>If it has been less than 48 hours since it corrupted then I can restore to the exact point before it corrupted with an inaccuracy of at most 3 hours (if you're monitoring trends you don't want to lose hours worth of data, so an average accuracy of 1.5 is pretty good),</p> <p>If 48 hours have passed then I can restore to any point with a maximum inaccuracy of 1 day (average accuracy of 12 hours) over the past 7 days (excluding the two where the db was corrupted).</p> <p>Over a week I can restore to any point \u00b11 week over the past 3 weeks, while \u00b11 week isn't very useful for restoring a database, it can be useful for subtle thing you don't notice, like if you accidentally deleted something.</p> <p>This is substantially more efficient than storing a backup every 3 hours for a month, and while you lose some accuracy as the backups get older, most failures (if they even occur) will be noticed within 48 hours,</p> <p>Also, most things other than your database don't change that often so a 4-week-old backup of your home assistant config may be the same as 1 day old backup. Also in my case the 3 hourly backup only backs up the important files to save on storage, whereas my daily/weekly backups are full backups.</p> <p>Of course, you can tweak these values to your liking, or even add a month/yearly backup schedule .</p>"},{"location":"advanced-examples/#automations","title":"Automations","text":"Partial backup every 3 hours<pre><code>- alias: \"AutoBackup: Hourly Backup\"\ntrigger: #
